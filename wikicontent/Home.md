# Deprecation/Archival Notice

As of February 1, 2024, YamlToBot and all associated repositories will be archived, and the website will be defunct. The project has outlived it's usefulness for me and hasn't been updated in so long to the point where it likely does not work anymore--and even if it does, you shouldn't use it. If you're interested in taking ownership and continuing the project, please reach out to me [via email](mailto:justin@justinschaaf.com) so we can work something out.

If you're still interested in what I've been up to all these years, [my website](https://justinschaaf.com) links to various projects and socials you may find interesting. Thank you for your support.
